The MSD in x, y, and z are all look close to the exact solution but with very smooth noise. This is because there is correlation between the displacement being calculated. When plotted with the no-correlation, no overlapping windows conditions, the noise is much more erratic however we know there is no correlation between the positions being used to calculate displacement, so this is more accurate.

The total D is fairly accurate (see D_results.txt). We have kt=1 and zeta=1, therefore we can expect D to be approx. 1.

Since D = kT/zeta, it makes sense that the LD simulation shows a positive linear relationship between D and kT.

I expected an inverse relationship between D and zeta (friction coefficient). This does not seem to be accurately shown using LD, although I think this may be due to the fact that I have not changed my correlation window in the LD code. To know what this correlation window should be however, I would need to run the MSD code with correlated displacements calculated, which takes a very long time (and the assignment says I don't need to do this). When the MSD for zeta=0.001 is plotted on a log-log plot, it shows almost purely ballistic motion. This means I could also explore the results with many more integration steps (however this would take much more timea and the assignment says to go to a maximum of 1 million integration steps). I would guess that with these things changed I would get a more accurate representation of the relationship between D and zeta.

The diffusion coefficient D does not depend on m so a relationship is not expected, however the results from the LD look like an inverse relationship (D=1/m). This could be explored with more data.
